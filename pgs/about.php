	<p>Hi, my name is Ryan and I was a mature student with the Open University.  As part of my final project, myCocktailor was created to provide a public cocktail database that supports conversion between international units of measurement.</p>

	<p>I have aimed to supply a simple, accessible and intuitive system that allows people from all over the globe create, share and collect cocktails recipes that can be tailored to their preferred units of measurement.</p>

	<p>I you need to get in touch with me, you can reach me at ryan&#64;myCocktailor</p>

	<p>Thanks for using myCocktailor,</p>

	<p>Ryan.</p>
